# Localizeflow

Effortless localization automation for documentation.

Localizeflow is a GitHub-native automation infrastructure
that removes the operational burden of multilingual documentation.

Built for developers, open-source maintainers,
and early-stage teams who want localization to run
without reviewers, vendors, or complex workflows.

## The problem

Localization is not blocked by translation quality.

It is blocked by operations.

Most localization platforms assume one thing:

**Every translation must be reviewed and managed by humans.**

That assumption creates:
- reviewer management
- approval workflows and QA gates
- vendor coordination
- dashboards and project overhead
- enterprise-grade pricing

As a result, localization becomes slow, expensive,

and inaccessible to most teams.

So teams decide not to localize at all.

## Who this is for



Localizeflow is for teams that:

- do not have reviewers

- do not want vendor contracts

- ship documentation frequently

- do not want to spend time setting up localization workflows

- want localization to run automatically



This includes:

- open-source maintainers

- indie developers

- early-stage startups

- fast-moving product teams



These teams need localization the most,

but cannot afford to operate or configure it.

## Relationship to Co-op Translator



Localizeflow is built on top of **Co-op Translator**,

a Microsoft open-source translation engine

maintained under the Azure GitHub organization.



Co-op Translator provides the core translation capabilities.



Localizeflow adds:

- orchestration and scheduling

- execution reliability

- GitHub-native delivery

- operational abstraction



Together, they enable localization

that scales without human maintenance.

## How it works



Localizeflow runs as a background automation layer

that keeps translations continuously in sync

as source documentation evolves.



Documentation changes.

Translations stay aligned.
