# Localizeflow

Effortless localization automation for documentation.

Localizeflow is a GitHub-native automation infrastructure
that removes the operational burden of multilingual documentation.

Built for developers, open-source maintainers,
and early-stage teams who want localization to run
without reviewers, vendors, or complex workflows.

## Relationship to Co-op Translator

Localizeflow is built on top of **Co-op Translator**,

which helps anyone read the latest educational repositories in the language they’re most comfortable with.

Localizeflow adds:

- orchestration and scheduling
- execution reliability
- GitHub-native delivery
- operational abstraction

## How it works

Localizeflow runs as a background automation layer that keeps translations continuously in sync as source documentation evolves.

Documentation changes.

Translations stay aligned.
