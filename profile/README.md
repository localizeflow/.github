# Localizeflow

Effortless localization automation for documentation.

Localizeflow is a GitHub-native automation infrastructure
that removes the operational burden of multilingual documentation.

Built for developers, open-source maintainers,
and early-stage teams who want localization to run
without reviewers, vendors, or complex workflows.

## Relationship to Co-op Translator

Localizeflow is built on top of **Co-op Translator**,

a Microsoft open-source translation engine

maintained under the Azure GitHub organization.

Co-op Translator provides the core translation capabilities.

Localizeflow adds:

- orchestration and scheduling

- execution reliability

- GitHub-native delivery

- operational abstraction

Together, they enable localization

that scales without human maintenance.

## How it works

Localizeflow runs as a background automation layer

that keeps translations continuously in sync

as source documentation evolves.

Documentation changes.

Translations stay aligned.
